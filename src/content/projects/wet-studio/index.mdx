## The Studio

Wet Studio is an experimental ceramics practice based in Oakland, creating functional objects and sculptural works that blur the line between craft and fine art.

## Identity System

The brand identity embraces the fluid, unpredictable nature of working with clay. The logotype features custom letterforms that feel hand-formed, while the color palette draws from natural glazes and raw materials.

## Applications

We designed a complete identity system including business cards, packaging for shipped pieces, studio signage, and a simple website that showcases their work with minimal interference.
