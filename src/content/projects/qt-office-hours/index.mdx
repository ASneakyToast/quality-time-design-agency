## The Exhibition

Quality Time Office Hours was a publication exhibition at CCA's MFA Design Studio, running November 2-16, 2025. The space merged professional output and personal practice in a hybrid environment combining office, living room, and library functions.

## Concept

Visitors encountered various projects and catalogues designed for viewing, reflection, and copying—positioning these works simultaneously as art and reference materials. The studio operated as both gallery and workspace, deliberately infiltrating the 9-to-5 and blurring the lines between cultural input and output.

## Local Archive

The exhibition showcased selected Bay Area galleries and presses, bringing a shared local archive into CCA's MFA studio. This emphasized how local creative communities form the foundational infrastructure supporting institutional spaces.

## Details

**Hours:** 3pm-7pm
**Location:** MFA Design Studio 230, CCA main building, 450 Irwin St, San Francisco
