## The Project

The San Francisco Standard is a local news outlet known for its punchy approach to journalism. We created a limited edition tote bag collection featuring bold typographic exploration.

## Design Approach

The design captures the publication's voice—fun, edgy, and representative of their direct editorial identity. The typography plays with scale and attitude, translating the Standard's journalistic personality into wearable form.

## Deliverables

Limited edition tote bags featuring custom typographic treatments that celebrate San Francisco and the publication's distinctive character.
