## The Exhibition

A visual identity system for the California College of the Arts MFA Design program's graduating class of 2023.

## Concept

The designers embraced "interference" as a core concept—utilizing digital and analog techniques of interference to build a unique and raw identity. The work reflects an experimental philosophy where designers lean into the unknown made by interlacing unfamiliar frequencies of research and form-making.

## Applications

The system was applied across both a digital website and physical exhibition space, challenging conventional design practices by treating typically undesirable elements—interference, disruption, and misuse of materials—as creative opportunities.
