## The Event

Open Studio was a happy hour event for EYRC Architects at the AIA'23 Conference in San Francisco.

## Design Approach

The event branding was developed using software for typographic folding in conjunction with the Origami Simulator. The simulator created a three-dimensional object from a two-dimensional design element, resulting in a raw semi-malfunctional 3D object.

## Technique

The project showcases experimental typography and 3D modeling techniques applied to event branding materials.
