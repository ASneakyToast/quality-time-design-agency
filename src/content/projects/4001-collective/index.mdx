## The Organization

4001 Collective is a community-focused organization centered on social justice and abolitionist principles.

## Design Approach

A distinctive "hacked logo" concept was developed for digital brand applications, featuring minor typographic variables within the logo to expand the language and complement the concept of community engagement.
