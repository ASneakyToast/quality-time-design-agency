## The Exhibition

Foul Odor: An Exhibition on Survival was a group show presented at Upper Market Gallery in San Francisco, curated by Off Hours.

## Design Approach

Working alongside Savithri Velaga, we designed a digital-hybrid exhibition identity that aligned with the DIY essence of the show. The visual system bridges physical and digital presentation, maintaining the grassroots character of the exhibition while creating a cohesive identity across platforms.

## Applications

The identity extended across promotional materials, exhibition graphics, window displays, and digital assets—each element reinforcing the show's raw, survival-focused theme.
