## The Fair

SF Art Book Fair is an annual celebration of independent publishing, bringing together artists, designers, and makers from around the world to share zines, artist books, and printed matter.

## Brand Identity

We developed a vibrant visual identity that captures the DIY spirit and creative energy of the independent publishing community. The system is designed to feel accessible and playful while maintaining a sophisticated edge.

## Event Materials

The identity extends across all fair touchpoints—from wayfinding and signage to programs and merchandise—creating a cohesive experience that celebrates the printed word.
