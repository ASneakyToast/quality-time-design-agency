## The Concept

Water the Flowers began as a personal meditation—a daily ritual of tending to plants that became an exploration of patience, care, and the slow magic of growth.

## Visual Language

The visual system draws from botanical illustration traditions while embracing the happy accidents of risograph printing. Each piece celebrates imperfection and the organic nature of both plants and print.

## Process

Working with a limited palette of three spot colors, we developed a series of 12 prints that could exist independently or as a collected set. The risograph process added its own character—slight misregistrations and ink variations that make each print unique.

## Impact

The series sold out within 48 hours and has been featured in Print Magazine's annual design showcase.
