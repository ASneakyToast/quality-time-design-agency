## The Festival

Dive Barn is an annual arts and music festival held at Yorkville Schoolhouse Ranch, stewarded by the Henderson/Carlson family. Launched in 2024, the event celebrates creativity and connection through performances and artistic participation in a rural setting.

## Design Direction

The identity draws inspiration from fossilized technology and corporatized agriculture systems—but deliberately subverts these references. The direction functions as an archival logo, embracing a lo-fi, process-driven sensibility that rejects conventional approaches.

## Process

The visual system incorporates experimental printing techniques using natural elements—sunlight exposure, insect interactions, and gardening ecosystems—as integral design components.

## Collaborators

Created in collaboration with Joel Lithgow (This is a House Gallery), Katherine Jemima Hamilton (Off Hours), and the Henderson/Carlson family.
