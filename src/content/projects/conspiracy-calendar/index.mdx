## The Idea

What if we took the absurdist humor of conspiracy theories and gave them the serious design treatment they absolutely don't deserve? The Conspiracy Calendar was born from late-night conversations and a shared appreciation for the weird corners of the internet.

## Visual Approach

Each month features a meticulously illustrated conspiracy theory rendered in a vintage scientific illustration style—lending an air of credibility to claims about flat earth, chemtrails, and the moon landing.

## Featured Conspiracies

- January: Birds Aren't Real
- February: The Mandela Effect
- March: Flat Earth Society
- April: Area 51
- May: Chemtrails
- June: The Moon Landing
- July: Bigfoot
- August: The Illuminati
- September: Time Travelers
- October: Crop Circles
- November: The Matrix Theory
- December: Y2K Bug (Dormant)

## Reception

The calendar became an unexpected viral hit, with features in Dezeen and It's Nice That celebrating its deadpan approach to absurdist content.
