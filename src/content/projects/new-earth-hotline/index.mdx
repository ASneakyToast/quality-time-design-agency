## The Collective

New Earth Hotline is an experimental art collective creating work at the intersection of ecology, spirituality, and community building. Their practice spans performance, publication, and participatory events.

## Visual Identity

The identity needed to feel both grounded and otherworldly—rooted in natural systems while suggesting alternative futures. We developed a fluid visual language that shifts and adapts across applications.

## The Book

A 120-page publication documenting their first two years of work, featuring essays, photography, and ephemera collected from events and interventions.
