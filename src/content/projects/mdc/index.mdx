## The Conference

Monterey Design Conference brings together designers, creatives, and makers for three days of talks, workshops, and connection on California's stunning central coast.

## Brand Identity

We developed a dynamic identity system that captures the energy of the conference while nodding to the natural beauty of its coastal setting. The visual language adapts across applications while maintaining a cohesive voice.

## Event Collateral

From badges to banners, programs to posters, the system extends across all touchpoints of the conference experience—creating a unified environment that enhances the gathering.
