## The Collective

MDC brings together dealers, collectors, and enthusiasts of mid-century modern furniture and design. They needed an identity that felt era-appropriate without being pastiche.

## Brand Identity

We developed a restrained identity system drawing from the geometric precision and material honesty of mid-century design. The typography pairs a geometric sans with a refined serif, echoing the era's balance of warmth and rigor.

## Digital Platform

The website serves as both a marketplace and editorial destination, featuring dealer profiles, educational content, and a curated selection of pieces.
