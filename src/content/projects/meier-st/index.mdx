## The Space

Meier St is a community and creativity hub located in a 1948 Gregory Ain home in Mar Vista, Los Angeles. The space serves as a gathering point for artists, designers, and creative practitioners.

## Design Direction

The logo direction was inspired by Gregory Ain's architectural philosophy—a desire that each individual structure remain simple while functioning as flexible components of a larger whole. This principle guided the visual identity, creating a mark that is restrained yet adaptable.

## Identity System

The branding reflects the modernist sensibility of the mid-century architecture while remaining contemporary and versatile across applications.
