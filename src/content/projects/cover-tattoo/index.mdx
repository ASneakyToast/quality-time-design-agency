## The Project

Cover Tattoo is a 200+ page photo book celebrating the artistry and emotional significance of cover-up tattoos. Each spread pairs intimate photography with the personal stories of transformation.

## Design Considerations

The book design needed to let the artwork speak while providing context for each piece's significance. We developed a restrained typographic system that frames without competing.

## Production

Printed as a limited edition of 500 copies with a debossed soft-touch cover and lay-flat binding to honor the full-bleed photography.
