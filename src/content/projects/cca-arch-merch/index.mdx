## The Brief

California College of the Arts approached us to create a merchandise collection that would celebrate their long-standing partnership with ARCH Art Supplies—a San Francisco institution.

## Approach

We developed a visual system that bridges the institutional identity of CCA with the raw, creative energy of an art supply store. The result: utilitarian objects elevated through thoughtful typography and material choices.

## The Collection

- Canvas tote bags with screen-printed graphics
- Enamel pins featuring architectural details from both locations
- Custom sketchbooks with specially formulated paper stock
- Limited edition T-shirts in collaboration with local printmakers

## Materials

Every item was produced locally in the Bay Area, prioritizing sustainable materials and supporting the local maker community that both CCA and ARCH have nurtured for decades.
