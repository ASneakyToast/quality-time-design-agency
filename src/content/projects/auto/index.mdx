## The Publication

AUTO is an independent magazine celebrating automotive culture beyond the mainstream—featuring custom builds, racing heritage, and the people who dedicate their lives to machines.

## Design Approach

We developed a bold typographic system that echoes the industrial precision of automotive engineering while maintaining editorial warmth. The layout balances dramatic full-bleed photography with considered white space.

## Print Details

Each issue is printed on uncoated stock with spot UV details on the cover, emphasizing the tactile nature of both print and automotive culture.
